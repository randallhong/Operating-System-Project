# Operating-System-Project
This is our operating system projects at WPI.(Assigned by Jerry D. Breecher(P))
I only finished "base.c",which has the basic logic codes to manage an "OS".
To test whether the codes I wrote in "base.c" meet those basic features or not,such as memory management, process management,disk management, and message management, there is a file called "test.c" to test the codes.
