# Operating-System-Project
This is my CS 502 "Operating System" project at WPI.(Assigned by Jerry D. Breecher(P))
For this project, I have three basic features needed to be finished, which are Process Management, Virtual Memory Management, and Disk Management.
This project is like a test-driven project. So proffessor has arealdy written some tests I need to pass in the "test.c" file.
I only write the "base.c" file, which has the basic but the most important codes to manage an "OS".
